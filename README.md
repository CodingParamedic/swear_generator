I wanted to build something tonight so i started putting together a silly insult generator

The intent is for the person to input "Yes" when asked if they insulted the computer, and a
randomly generated silly insult is kicked out.

I'm modifying some of my code from the Blackjack game, but i'll admit i'm hitting a wall tonight.

No errors, which is good, but it's not running either.

In any case, i'm going to bed. Lemmem know what you think of it so far, and lemme know if you have
any other silly insult ideas.
